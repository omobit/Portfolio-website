            <h3>Define</h3>
            <p>
              As the world recovers from a global pandemic, the amount of online
              sales and transactions has increased as more people opt for online
              shopping and services. As a result, users want safe, secure, and
              accessible means to enjoy the benefits of shopping online and
              accessing banking services without requiring their physical cards
              for payments.
            </p>
            <h4>Learning from user research</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Respondent commonly used their digital wallet for day-to-day
                spending and activities. This means they want to keep and access
                everyday items such as loyalty cards, passes or transport cards
                in addition to bank cards
              </li>
              <li>
                Respondents are also looking for incentives and rewards they can
                receive when using digital wallets. this includes the
                integration of loyalty cards and coupons made a difference in
                their spending experience.
              </li>
              <li>
                Security and transparency are important for respondents as they
                want to be able to know and trust that their privacy is
                protected.
              </li>

            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <p>
              Using the research gathered from the survey, interviews and
              conducting a competitive analysis, I created two personas to bring
              to life the information gathered and support my thinking when
              making decisions about the PlutoPay Platform. I create needs,
              goals and challenges faced by personas and utilise a task flow to
              visualise the journey users would encounter using PlutoPay to
              reach their intended goal.

            <h3>Wireframe and prototype</h3>
            <p>
              Using all the information gathered through user research and
              personas created, creating low and mid-fidelity wireframes was a
              key next step in mapping the process of three chosen features on
              the PlutoPay platform. One of the key methods I used to reduce
              cognitive load was building on mental models that already existed
              and were familiar to users. I also made sure to use CTA and
              language that would be familiar to users to ensure that actions
              such as setting up two-factor authentication which can seem
              complicated were explained at each step what users need to achieve
              their goal.

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
              Overall six participants were interviewed within one of the target
              groups (20-29 years old). Participants were recruited from
              personal networks and word of mouth. The usability tests took
              place remotely online over Zoom and in person in moderated
              sessions.
            </p>
            <h4>Learning from usablity tests</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                All 6 participants raised the navigation bar as an error which
                impacted their experience when using the prototype. They
                questioned each navigation icon and did not understand what
                would be on each page
              </li>
              <li>
                3 out of 6 participants raised adding a new card as a common
                barrier they faced due to how unclear the process was and no
                confirmation given to let them know their action had been
                successful
              </li>
              <li>
                4 out of 6 participants raised that they were unable to tell the
                difference between transaction and payment page and homepage.
                They agreed it could just be one page and spending activity
                could be a standalone page
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Conclusion and Next steps</h3>
            <p>
              PlutoPay offers users a secure alternative to physical bank cards,
              enabling them to shop, transfer money, and more without the need
              for a debit or credit card or visiting a physical bank or store.
              The platform valuable resources through articles on financial
              management and online safety, helping users protect their
              financial information from fraud.
            </p>
            <h4>Next steps</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Continue to further develop the PlutoPay platform and testing
                features such as the article section and budgeting with users
              </li>
              <li>
                The homepage requires further development in how information is
                presented to users, particularly the preview of card information
                as a carousel that can be filtered or a different layout that
                users can easily navigate.
              </li>
              <li>
                As my design evolves and becomes much more polished, I can see
                my user testing methods being moderated and in person where
                possible to gauge users' real-time experience with the
                application
              </li>
