                <h3>Define</h3>
                <p>
                    As the world recovers from a global pandemic, the amount of online sales and transactions has increased as more people opt for online shopping and services. As a result, users want safe, secure, and accessible means to enjoy the benefits of shopping online and accessing banking services without requiring their physical cards for payments.
                    <h4>Learning from user research</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Respondent commonly used their digital wallet for day-to-day spending and activities. This means they want to keep and access everyday items such as loyalty cards, passes or transport cards in addition to bank cards</li>
                        <li>Respondents are also looking for incentives and rewards they can receive when using digital wallets. this includes the integration of loyalty cards and coupons made a difference in their spending experience. </li>
                        <li>Security and transparency are important for respondents as they want to be able to know and trust that their privacy is protected.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Ideate</h3>
                <p>
                    Using the research gathered from the survey, interviews and conducting a competitive analysis, I created two personas to bring to life the information gathered and support my thinking when making decisions about the PlutoPay Platform. I create needs, goals and challenges faced by personas and utilise a task flow to visualise the journey users would encounter using PlutoPay to reach their intended goal.

                <h3>Wireframe and prototype</h3>
                <p>
                    Using all the information gathered through user research and personas created, creating low and mid-fidelity wireframes was a key next step in mapping the process of three chosen features on the PlutoPay platform. One of the key methods I used to reduce cognitive load was building on mental models that already existed and were familiar to users.
                    I also made sure to use CTA and language that would be familiar to users to ensure that actions such as setting up two-factor authentication which can seem complicated were explained at each step what users need to achieve their goal.

                <h3>Testing</h3>
                <p>
                    Overall six participants were interviewed within one of the target groups (20-29 years old). Participants were recruited from personal networks and word of mouth. The usability tests took place remotely online over Zoom and in person in moderated sessions.
                    <h4>Learning from usablity tests</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>All 6 participants raised the navigation bar as an error which impacted their experience when using the prototype. They questioned each navigation icon and did not understand what would be on each page</li>
                        <li>3 out of 6 participants raised adding a new card as a common barrier they faced due to how unclear the process was and no confirmation given to let them know their action had been successful </li>
                        <li>4 out of 6 participants raised that they were unable to tell the difference between transaction and payment page and homepage. They agreed it could just be one page and spending activity could be a standalone page</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion and Next steps</h3>
                <p>
                    PlutoPay offers users a secure alternative to physical bank cards, enabling them to shop, transfer money, and more without the need for a debit or credit card or visiting a physical bank or store. 
                    The platform valuable resources through articles on financial management and online safety, helping users protect their financial information from fraud.
                    <h4>Next steps</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Continue to further develop the PlutoPay platform and testing features such as the article section and budgeting with users</li>
                        <li>The homepage requires further development in how information is presented to users, particularly the preview of card information as a carousel that can be filtered or a different layout that users can easily navigate.</li>
                        <li>As my design evolves and becomes much more polished, I can see my user testing methods being moderated and in person where possible to gauge users' real-time experience with the application</li>
                    </ul>
